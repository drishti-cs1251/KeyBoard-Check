# KeyBoard-Check

The Keyboard-Check Project is a simple web application that detects and displays the key pressed on the keyboard in real-time. It uses the "keydown" event to capture the key press.

## Feature: Displays the pressed key and its key code instantly.

## How It Works
1. When a key is pressed, the keydown event is triggered.

2. The JavaScript function captures the key and code values.

3. The UI updates to display the key and code inside a table.
